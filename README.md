My To-Do List App
Welcome to My To-Do List App! This open-source project is a simple and efficient way to organize your daily tasks. It was inspired by a tutorial I followed and has been a great learning experience for me.

Features
Add Tasks: Easily add new tasks to your list.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Keep track of tasks you’ve accomplished.
Delete Tasks: Remove tasks you no longer need.
Local Storage Integration: Your tasks are saved directly to your browser's local storage, so they persist even after refreshing the page.
What I Learned
Working on this project has been an incredible opportunity to dive into:

Local Storage: Implementing local storage to save and retrieve tasks without requiring a backend.
Complex Conditional Logic: Building robust logic using if-else statements to handle various task scenarios dynamically.
JavaScript DOM Manipulation: Creating an interactive user interface with real-time updates.
